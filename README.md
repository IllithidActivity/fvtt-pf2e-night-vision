This module helps simulate the Night Vision talent in the WFRP4e system. The dim illumination of all light sources is increased for controlled tokens with the Night Vision talent/trait.

The module assumes your grid units are in yards.

This module does not automate giving vision to tokens in areas with no light. I suggest you give 20 yards vision as a work-around (either manually or via a macro).
