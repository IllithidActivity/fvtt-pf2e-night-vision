This module partially automates the Night Vision talent in the WFRP4e system. The effective illumination radius of all light sources is extended for a selected token with the Night Vision talent or trait.

This is my first module so the functionality is extremely rudimentary at this stage. 

The module assumes your grid units are in yards.
For the cases where Night Vision applies for faint sources of light, I suggest giving the token 20ft darkvision.
